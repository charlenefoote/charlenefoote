			<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voqel/id563420421" target="_blank">Voqel</a> is an iOS app that allows users to share their voice. Sound clips can be uploaded, categorized, commented on, shared and discovered. As part of the <a href="http://www.bigseadesign.com" target="_blank">Big Sea Design & Development</a> team, I played the role of UI designer creating and cultivating the visual details of this socially dynamic app.</p>

			<p>From the splash screen to multiple detailed views, the design is clean and concise to allow easy interaction and consistency. Various blue hues are used to lead the users' eye to important sections and functions of the site.</p>
