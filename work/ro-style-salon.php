			<p>The client, a couple who own a hair salon, was looking to establish more of a web presence. <a href="http://www.rostylesalon.com" target="_blank">Ro Style</a> had a steady, preexisting client-base, but they were looking to expand. This site aims to grow their salon business/clientele in addition to serving existing clients with contact information, links to social media and schedule appointments using an a external link.</p>

			<p>This custom Wordpress theme design is responsive, classic and minimal. It was built using Wordpress to give the client editing capabilities and to allow future growth of the site. The animations and transitions were developed using SCSS and a little jQuery magic.</p>
