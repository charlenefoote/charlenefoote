			<p><a href="http://keepsaintpetersburglocal.org/" target="_blank">Keep Saint Petersburg Local</a> is a wonderful, non-profit organization aimed at keeping businesses and consumers local. The client hired <a href="http://www.bigseadesign.com" target="_blank">Big Sea Design & Development</a> team for two things: a funky, fresh design and development of a membership and eCommerce platform. As part of that team, I lead the design and was the front-end developer.</p>

			<p>Because of the nature of the organization, the design direction was a nod to the mom and pop, retro style. It features details, icons, fonts that harken back to a mix of vintage styles from the 40s to the 60s. The site was developed using ExpressionEngine of which I was involved in template development and styling.</p>
