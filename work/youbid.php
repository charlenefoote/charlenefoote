Sound clips can be uploaded, categorized, commented on, shared and discovered. With the <a href="http://www.bigseadesign.com" target="_blank">Big Sea Design & Development</a> team, I played the role of UI designer. 	</p>

			<p>Because of the nature of the organization, the design direction was a nod to the mom and pop, retro style. It features details, icons, fonts that harken back to a mix of vintage styles from the 40s to the 60s. The site was developed using ExpressionEngine of which I assisted with template development and styling.</p>
