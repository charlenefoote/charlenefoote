				<p>For the past eight years I've been designing user experiences&mdash;six of those years were focused on urban mobility. Currently, I'm apart of the <a href="http://remix.com" target="_blank">Remix</a> team building tools that give cities a means to create equitable transportation outcomes. Previously, I worked on a transit ticketing mobile app at <a href="https://moovel-group.com/en" target="_blank">moovel</a> and on a carsharing platform at <a href="http://getaround.com" target="_blank">Getaround</a>. Also, I'm a mentor at <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/ckayfoote/" target="_blank">Designlab</a>.

				<p>Just in case you are still reading this, here are some unnecessary facts about me. I was born in a flamingo pink hospital in Honolulu. I'm a gosh darn ex-Floridian. I have 35+ plants living in my home. I saw a UFO and this can be corroborated. I'm a hot dog pundit. Writing with a felt tip pen is my equivolent to scissors gliding through paper. I've been car-free for seven years.</p>
