				<p>For the past seven years, I've been designing digital interfaces and experiences. Right now, I'm working on a transit app at <a href="https://moovel-group.com/en" target="_blank">moovel</a> where we're making urban transportation suck less. Also, I'm a mentor at <a href="http://trydesignlab.com/ckayfoote/" target="_blank">Designlab</a>. Previously, I was at <a href="http://getaround.com" target="_blank">Getaround</a> working on a carsharing platform.

				<p>Just in case you are still reading this, here are some unnecessary facts about me. I like hot dogs and chocolate chip cookies. I was born in Honolulu. I'm an ex-Floridian. I've seen a UFO. I like soccer but it's called football. A felt tip pen is the preferred writing tool.</p>
