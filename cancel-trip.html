		<h2>Cancel Trip</h2>
		<p>iOS + Android</p>.
	</div>
	<div class="column">
		<p>At Getaround I led the design of Cancel Trip, a way for renters to cancel their car rental through the iOS app. I was responsible for UX research, wireframing, copywriting, ideating, visual design, prototyping, and user testing.</p>

		<h4>Understanding the Problem</h4>
		<p>Before this feature was introduced, renters had to call or email Getaround customer service in order to cancel a tripâ€“both of which require waiting periods and cause friction. This manual process was the source of a significant amount of work for the customer service team. Trip cancellations were the number one reason for calls made to customer service.</p>

		<p>By working with the PM and the customer support team, I gathered data about when and why these cancellations were happening. This would later inform business rules and logic around the cancellation policy.</p>

		<h4>Constraints</h4>
		<p>In order to truly bring down customer service call volume, we would need to consider 1) car renters and car owners 2) web and mobile 3) cancelling AND modifying a trip. Because of resourcing, this project was scoped as Phase 1 of a multiphase approach.</p>
		<p>

		<h4>Objectives</h4>
		<p>After defining the problem, the PM, the customer service lead, and I agreed on a set of objectives:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allow the renter to easily cancel trips through the iOS app.</li>
			<li>Give the renter clear information about cancellation policies and fees.</li>
			<li>Ensure the collection of appropriate cancellation fees.</li>
			<li>Success metric: bring down customer service call volume down by 30% (Phase 1).</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>User Flows</h4>
		<p>I mapped out a task flow of a user's journey from before it trip started until after to understand how the cancellation policy would affect users and map out various scenarios.</p>
		<h4>Scenarios:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The renter wants to cancel their trip 24hrs or more before it starts OR less than an hour after they booked it.</li>
			<li>The renter cancels their trip but is refunded less than they were expecting. They'd like to understand why and dispute it.</li>
			<li>The renter wants to cancel their trip less than 24hrs before it starts OR longer than an hour after they booked it.</li>
			<li>The renter wants to cancel their trip after it has started.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Introducing another action</h4>
	<p>There are several actions the renter can take when renting a car. Also, those actions change depending on whether the trip is in the past, present, or future. For example, a renter can extend a rental either before or during the trip period. Also, a renter can unlock their rental car during a trip, but not before the trip starts.</p>
	<p>As part of the objectives, I explored ways to include and introduce this new action, Cancel Trip, into the existing design. It was important to make this new action easy to find.</p>
	<p>It was important to keep this action accessible even if the renter isn't within the cancellation period. Instead of hiding the feature we could be informative and provide guidance.</p>

	<h4>Understanding cancellation reasons, fees, and policies</h4>
	<p>In order to keep a balanced peer-to-peer carsharing marketplace, we needed to consider a fair set of fees and policies. As a business goal, we would collect a different set of fees based on our policies. This meant renters would need a clear understanding of refund amounts.</p>
	<p>We also wanted to make sure we were collection information that would help us understand why these cancellations were happening. This would help us identify problems or even opportunities in the future.</p>

		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<p>Iterating, Prototyping and the Conclusion</p>
	</div>
	<div class="column">
		<h4>Testing and Iterating</h4>
		<p>The first several iterations focused on creating a tour that felt light and contextual. I explored different ways to introduce the new look of the ticket and the changes to navigation. This also included copy explorations to find the right words to inform the user of the value of the redesign and to reassure them.</p>
		<p>Further iterations were necessary to test usability. Because users could find themselves in the tour with the intention of purchasing and/or activating a ticket, it was important to understand how quickly and accurately users could swipe through or leave the tour. I built several prototypes to test and challenge my assumptions of how users would move through it.</p>
		<h4>Measuring Success</h4>
		<p>Once the app launches, we can track how quickly users tap the 'Skip' button. In addition to analytics, we will be conducting contextual interviews and monitoring app store reviews that could reveal general sentiment around the tour.</p>
		<h4>Learnings</h4>
		<p>This tour was not considered and designed alongside the first-time user onboarding experience. This work was primarily focused on existing users. The new user onboarding experience was designed at the beginning of the app redesign. This caused a gap in the experience for an existing user who is logged out and treated as a new user.</p>
