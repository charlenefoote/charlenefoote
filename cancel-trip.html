		<h4>About Getaround</h4>
		<p>Getaround is a carsharing platform where owners rent out their cars to people nearby. It allows renters to instanty rent cars by the hour or even daily.
		</p>
		<h4>My Role</h4>
		<p>I led the design of Cancel Trip, a way for renters to cancel their car rental through the iOS app. I was responsible for UX research, wireframing, copywriting, ideating, testing, and UI design.</p>

		<h4>Understanding the Problem</h4>
		<p>Before this feature was introduced, renters had to call or email Getaround customer support in order to cancel a trip&mdash;both of which require waiting periods and cause friction. This manual process was the source of a significant amount of work for the customer support team. Trip cancellations were the number one reason for calls made to customer support.</p>

		<h4>Constraints</h4>
		<p>In order to truly bring down customer support call volume, we would need to consider 1) car renters and car owners 2) web and mobile 3) cancelling AND modifying a trip. Because of resourcing, this project was scoped as Phase 1 of a multiphase approach.</p>
		<p>

		<h4>Objectives</h4>
		<p>After defining the problem, the PM, the customer support lead, and I agreed on a set of objectives:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Allow the renter to easily cancel trips through the iOS app.</li>
			<li>Give the renter clear information about cancellation policies and fees.</li>
			<li>Ensure the collection of appropriate cancellation fees.</li>
			<li>Success metric: bring down customer support call volume down by 30% (Phase 1).</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>User Flows</h4>
		<p>I mapped out a task flow to understand how the cancellation policy would affect renters and map out various scenarios.</p>
		<h4>Scenarios:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The renter wants to cancel their trip 24hrs or more before it starts OR less than an hour after they booked it.</li>
			<li>The renter cancels their trip but is refunded less than they were expecting. They'd like to understand why and dispute it.</li>
			<li>The renter wants to cancel their trip less than 24hrs before it starts OR longer than an hour after they booked it.</li>
			<li>The renter wants to cancel their trip after it has started.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4>Introducing another action</h4>
	<p>There are several actions the renter can take when renting a car. Also, those actions change depending on whether the trip is in the past, present, or future. For example, a renter can extend a rental either before or during the trip period. Also, a renter can unlock their rental car during a trip, but not before the trip starts.</p>
	<p>As part of the objectives, I explored ways to include and introduce this new action, Cancel Trip, into the existing design. It was important to make this new action easy to find. So we created wireframes and conducted usability tests.</p>
	<h4>Inform the Renter</h4>
	<p>It was important to keep this action accessible even outside of the  cancellation period. Instead of hiding the feature, we could use this opportunity to inform the renter of the cancellation policy.</p>

	<h4>Understanding cancellation reasons, fees, and policies</h4>
	<p>In order to keep a balanced peer-to-peer carsharing marketplace, we needed to consider a fair set of fees and policies. As a business goal, we needed to collect a different set of fees based on our policies. This meant renters would need a clear understanding of refund amounts.</p>
	<p>We also wanted to make sure we were collecting information that would help us understand why these cancellations were happening. This would help us identify problems or even opportunities in the future.</p>

		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<p>The Final Deliverables and the Conclusion</p>
	</div>
	<div class="column">
		<h4>Screen Flows</h4>
		<p>After creating high fidelity comps, I created screen flows that documented all of the scenarios and interactions that a renter would experience. This deliverable was used for engineering implementation.</p>
		<h4>Learnings</h4>
		<p>We leaned heavily on a tool tip to introduce a new feature. As a general principle, we should have pushed the design to be more intuitive.</p>
